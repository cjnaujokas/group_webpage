      <h2>Our Mission Statement</h2>
      <p>
        Were a group of tech enthusiasts who love tackling tough problems and building cool 
        things together. Our team is all about creativity, learning, and making a positive 
        impact with our work. We believe in the power of diverse ideas, having fun while we 
        code, and always pushing ourselves (and each other) to improve. Whether were brainstorming 
        or debugging, we bring our best and help each other out.
      </p>
      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Kind and Respectful:</strong> We’re here to support each other. No idea is too wild to share, 
            and every voice matters.</li>
          <li><strong> Accountable:</strong> We stick to our tasks and let each other know if we hit a roadblock. 
            If you’re stuck, don’t struggle alone—ask for help!</li>
          <li><strong>Keep Communication Open:</strong> Regular check-ins and updates are a must. We keep each other 
            in the loop and share feedback to stay on track.</li>
          <li><strong> Wins Over Solo Wins:</strong> We’re here to build something great together. Sharing credit 
            and celebrating each other's wins is part of our vibe.</li>
          <li><strong>Learn Together:</strong> There’s always something new to discover. We share skills, tips, and tricks 
            to keep everyone sharp.</li>
          <li><strong>Go with the Flow:</strong> Tech (and life) can throw curveballs. We stay flexible and keep a positive 
            attitude, ready to adapt when things change.</li>
        </ol>
